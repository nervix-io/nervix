Feature: Pulsar TLS resource mounts
  Scenario Outline: Pulsar ingestor consumes over native TLS with a mounted resource directory
    Given runtime replication is configured with replica count <replica_count> and snapshot interval "100ms"
    And a <cluster_size> node nervix cluster is started
    And the leader node is configured with these NSPL commands
      """
      CREATE UNPACED DOMAIN {{domain}};

    And node "node-1" has dev TLS resource directory "dev_tls"
    When these NSPL commands are executed
      """
      CREATE RESOURCE dev_tls;
      """
    And these NSPL commands are executed through the client on the leader node
      """
      UPLOAD RESOURCE dev_tls VERSION "{{dev_tls}}";
      """
    And these NSPL commands are executed
